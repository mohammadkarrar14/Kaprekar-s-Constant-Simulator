# Kaprekar's Constant Simulator

This project is a **Kaprekar's Constant Simulator** built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**. The purpose of the app is to simulate the process of reaching **Kaprekar's Constant (6174)** using any 4-digit number (where digits are not all the same) and performing the Kaprekar routine.

## Features
- Input a 4-digit number (not all digits can be the same).
- Automatically apply Kaprekarâ€™s routine to the input number.
- Visualize each iteration step until the number converges to **6174**.
- User-friendly interface to interact with the simulator.
- Built using React, Vite, and TypeScript.
